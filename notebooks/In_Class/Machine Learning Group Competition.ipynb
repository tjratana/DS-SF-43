    "##  Today's Mission\n",
    "- Your objective is to devise the best possible model to predict successful/default loans using a preprocessed version of the Lending Club loan dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class into divided into 2 groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The training data is 13689 loans labeled either as 1 (successful) or 0 (default). Comes with 30 categorical and numerical features. The testing data is also 13689 loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A data dictionary file is included as well. It is a table explaining each what each feature means.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Groups will judged on how much money their model makes. You will evaluate your model on the testing dataset. You cannot used testing data to train a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your profit will be determined by the amount of money you make from correctly predicting good loans (loan amount * interest rate/100.) subtracted by the money you lose from incorrectly predicting bad loans as good (-loan amount). I have given a function to calculate that.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finding the correct probability threshold will be super key in determing how much money you make.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VERY IMPORTANT:** You must transform your testing the data the same way you did your training data. So make sure you have the same columns in the same order.\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Stewart and I will be on be hand for guidance. However I want you to primarily use your teammates for help. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use all the tools at your disposal, try all the models we've learned in class. Refer to past class notebooks for help. Be sure to use modeling evaluating techniques such as ROC curves, confusion matrix, recall/precision, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I recommend starting off simple by using a small number of features\n",
    "\n",
    "- To optimize model, find the right combination of features and the right model with the right parameters. Get creative!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember to use your time wisely, it will go by fast. Communicate amongst yourselves often.\n",
